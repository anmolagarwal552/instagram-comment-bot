Photography takes an instant out of time, altering life by holding it still.
A thing that you see in my pictures is that I was not afraid to fall in love with these people.
Great photography is about depth of feeling, not depth of field.
I don’t trust words. I trust pictures.
It is more important to click with people than to click the shutter.
Taking pictures is like tiptoeing into the kitchen late at night and stealing Oreo cookies.
If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.
Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second.
Your first 1,000 photographs are your worst.
The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do.
You don’t take a photograph, you make it.
There are always two people in every picture: the photographer and the viewer.
Photography helps people to see.
